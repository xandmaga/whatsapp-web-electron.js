### This is an electron wrapper for [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) which connect using [puppeteer-in-electron](https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/puppeteer-in-electron).

A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app

It uses Puppeteer to run a real instance of Whatsapp Web to avoid getting blocked.

**NOTE:** I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.

* [npm][npm]

## Installation

The module is now available on [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/whatsapp-web-electron.js)! `npm i whatsapp-web-electron.js`

> [!NOTE]
> **Node ``v18+`` is required.**

## QUICK STEPS TO UPGRADE NODE

### Windows

#### Manual
Just get the latest LTS from the [official node website][nodejs].

#### npm
```powershell
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable
```

#### Choco
```powershell
choco install nodejs-lts
```

#### Winget
```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

### Ubuntu / Debian
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash - &&\
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## Example usage

```js
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-core');
const pie = require('puppeteer-in-electron');
const { Client } = require('whatsapp-web-electron.js');

const window = new BrowserWindow({
    // your options...
});

pie.connect(app, puppeteer).then((pieBrowser) => {
    const client = new Client(pieBrowser, window);

    // No need to listen for "qr" event as you can scan
    // the qr code directly in electron window

    client.on('ready', () => {
        console.log('Client is ready!');
    });

    client.on('message', msg => {
        if (msg.body == '!ping') {
            msg.reply('pong');
        }
    });

    client.initialize();
});
```

Take a look at [whatsapp-web.js example.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/blob/master/example.js) for another example with more use cases. The only difference should be the initialization process and a few feature (explained below).

## Preserving Sessions

The original project are using [Authentication Strategies](https://wwebjs.dev/guide/authentication.html) to save and restore sessions. No such thing are needed for electron since it already store its session, so the default `NoAuth` strategy works just fine.

## Remote Access and Docker

The original [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) has remote access feature and supports docker which is irrelevant for an electron project, that's why I didn't include it here.
